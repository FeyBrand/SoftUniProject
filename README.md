SoftUniProject
==============

Design and implement a funny Web site about SoftUni using HTML, CSS and optionally JavaScript. 
The site could hold jokes, funny pictures, funny videos, funny artwork, programmer's jokes or anything else that the people
at the Software University could find funny, entertaining and enjoyable and could make them smile. 
Your jokes could involve the people at SoftUni (e.g. the trainers), the students, the training labs and facilities, 
the training courses, the training videos, the homework, the exams, etc.
